Core Definition\\n\\n**Generative AI** refers to deep-learning models that learn the patterns and structures of input data (such as text, images, audio, or code) and then use that knowledge to **generate novel, realistic outputs** that mimic the style, structure, and content of the training data.\\n\\nIn simple terms, if traditional AI is about **recognition** (e.g., \"Is this a cat or a dog?\"), Generative AI is about **creation** (e.g., \"Draw me a picture of a cat riding a dog.\").\\n\\n## 2.
